# Android Sensors

Development options:

* Android Sensor Framework
* Third-party sensor libs:
  * Emotion Sense
  * Purple Robot
  * [GAST](https://github.com/gast-lib/gast-lib) Great Android Sensing
Toolkit.  Based on code from
[ Professional Android Sensor Programming](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118183487.html)
  * [Ketai](https://code.google.com/p/ketai/) Specific to [Processing](http://processing.org/)

## Sensor Fusion

"Sensor fusion is the combining of sensory data or data derived from
sensory data from disparate sources such that the resulting
information is in some sense better than would be possible when these
sources were used individually..."
([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensor_fusion))

Tutorial/Educational apps:

* [Free Android app teaches sensor fusion basics](https://community.freescale.com/community/the-embedded-beat/blog/2013/04/08/free-android-app-teaches-sensor-fusion-basics)
"This educational application by Freescale Semiconductor teaches you
about sensor fusion and lets you experiment with various fusion
options." (available at [Xtrinsic Sensor Fusion Toolbox](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.freescale.sensors.sfusion&feature=search_result)))
* [Sensor Fusion App](http://users.isy.liu.se/en/rt/fredrik/app/) from Linköping University (Sweden)

Lots of useful info on sensors and fusion at
[Kircher Electronics](http://www.kircherelectronics.com/blog/); lots
of example code at [KEOpenSource](https://github.com/KEOpenSource)

Libraries etc.:

* [Freescale Xtrinsic Sensor Fusion](http://www.freescale.com/webapp/sps/site/overview.jsp?code=XTRSICSNSTLBOX&tid=vansensorfusion)
* [Sensor Fusion](http://www.kionix.com/sensor-fusion) "Sensor
    fusion is software that intelligently combines data from several
    sensors for the purpose of improving application or system
    performance. Combining data from multiple sensors corrects for the
    deficiencies of the individual sensors to calculate accurate
    position and orientation information."
* [FreeMotion](http://www.sensorplatforms.com/freemotion-library/)
    "makes sensor fusion and user context awareness available in
    smartphones and tablets, to combine and process data from
    installed sensors and microprocessors, in order to better
    interpret users’ movements and situations, and infer their
    intents." (from Sensor Platforms (just acquired by
    [Audience](http://audience.com/component/zoo/item/audience-completes-acquisition-of-sensor-platformsw))
