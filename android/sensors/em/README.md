"Emotion Sense is an Android application that lets you explore how
your mood relates to the data that your smartphone can invisibly
capture as you carry it throughout the day."

It is built a collection of the "Emotion Sense" libraries:

* [ES Sensor Manager](https://github.com/xsenselabs/SensorManager) "easy way to access one-off and publish/subscribe interface to all the smartphone sensors"
* [ES Data Manager](https://github.com/xsenselabs/SensorDataManager) "allows you to store and bulk transfer sensor (or other application) data"
* [ES Trigger Manager](https://github.com/xsenselabs/TriggerManager) "notify your application when particular events happen. These triggers can be based on time (e.g., on a particular interval or randomly over a given period) or on sensor events (e.g., a call was received or the phone is moving)"
